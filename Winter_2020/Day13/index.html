                <p>Parents who used more positive words when speaking about the illnesses of their children and the
                    experience of medical decision making were more likely to report lower levels of positive affect on
                    the Panas.</p>

                <p>Nature has a great simplicity and therefore a great beauty. The poetry of earth is never dead. A
                    lake is a landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is Earth’s eye: looking into which
                    the beholder measures the depth of his own nature.</p>

                    stuntman, actor, and director whose perilous acrobatic stunts and engaging physical humour made him
