        Priyanka Chopra Jonas (pronounced [prɪˈjəŋka ˈtʃoːpɽa];[1] born 18 July 1982) is an Indian actress, singer, and
        film producer. The winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant, Chopra is one of India's highest-paid and most popular
        entertainers. She has received numerous accolades, including a National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards. In
        2016, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri and Time named her one of the 100 most
        influential people in the world, and in the next two years Forbes listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful
        Women.

        Although Chopra initially aspired to study aeronautical engineering, she accepted offers to join the Indian film
        industry, which came as a result of her pageant wins, making her Bollywood debut in The Hero: Love Story of a
        Spy (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and
        received critical acclaim for her breakout role in the 2004 thriller Aitraaz. Chopra established herself with
        starring roles in the top-grossing productions Krrish and Don (both 2006), and she later reprised her role in
        their sequels.
